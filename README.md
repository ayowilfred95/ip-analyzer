# IP Analyzer

The IP Analyzer project is designed with a primary focus on displaying two key data points: the user's public IP and latency information for Pylon. As these requirements are expected to evolve over time, potentially incorporating additional data points, we have built the project with extensibility in mind.

## Objective

The main objective of IP Analyzer is to provide users with essential information regarding their public IP address and latency details. By prioritizing extensibility, we ensure that the system can evolve and adapt to incorporate new data points seamlessly.

## Features

- Display the user's public IP address.
- Provide latency information for Pylon.
- Real-time display of IPv6 and IPv4 addresses using WebSocket technology.
- Flexibility to incorporate additional data points in the future.
- Modular and scalable design to accommodate future enhancements.
