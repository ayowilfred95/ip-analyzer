# IP Analyzer

The IP Analyzer project is designed with a primary focus on displaying two key data points: the user's public IP and latency information for Pylon. As these requirements are expected to evolve over time, potentially incorporating additional data points, we have built the project with extensibility in mind.

## Objective

The main objective of IP Analyzer is to provide users with essential information regarding their public IP address and latency details for Pylon. By prioritizing extensibility, we ensure that the system can evolve and adapt to incorporate new data points seamlessly.

## Features

- Display the user's public IP address.
- Provide latency information for Pylon.
- Real-time display of IPv6 and IPv4 addresses using WebSocket technology.
- Flexibility to incorporate additional data points in the future.
- Modular and scalable design to accommodate future enhancements.

## Extensibility

In the context of this project, extensibility refers to the system's capacity to grow and adapt with minimal effort. To achieve this, we have implemented a modular architecture that allows for the easy addition of new features and data points as requirements evolve. By investing in extensibility, we future-proof the project and ensure its longevity.

## How to Use

To use IP Analyzer, simply access the web application through your preferred web browser. The homepage will display your public IP address and latency information for Pylon in real-time. As new data points are added, they will seamlessly integrate into the existing interface, providing users with comprehensive insights.

## Future Enhancements

As the project continues to evolve, we plan to enhance IP Analyzer with additional features and data points based on user feedback and emerging requirements. These enhancements will further improve the utility and value of the application, ensuring it remains a valuable tool for users.
